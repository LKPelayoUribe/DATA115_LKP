## Motivation
Is there be a relationship between stocks that have a direct relationship to a specific cryptocurrency? Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it uses blockchain technology. A single Bitcoin was worth less than a penny in 2010 now in 2021 it has surpassed $60,000. Riot Blockchain is a company that mainly focuses on creating the software to mine Bitcoin. Does the stock price of Riot depend on the current price of Bitcoin?
